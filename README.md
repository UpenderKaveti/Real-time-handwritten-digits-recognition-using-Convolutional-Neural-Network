# Real-time-handwritten-digits-recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

# Description
Reading handwritten information like examination answer sheets is still a difficult task for many of us, because each one of us is having a different interpretation style. As the world is moving towards digitization, converting the hand written information to a readable digital format reduces the difficulty. This approach will be beneficial for the readers as it gives a better understanding of the information. With the help of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the hand written patterns can be recognized and classify them accordingly to a digital format with human level accuracy.

This repository deals with predicting the real time handwritten digits only. To classify the handwritten digits MNIST data set is used for training the model. OpenCV python library is used for detecting the patterns in the real time handwritten digits. These detected patterns are predicted to human level accuracy with the help of a Convolutional Neural Network model.
